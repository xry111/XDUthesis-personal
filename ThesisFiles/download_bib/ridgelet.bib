	abstract = {In dimensions two and higher, wavelets can efficiently represent only a small range of the full diversity of interesting behaviour. In effect, wavelets are well adapted for point{\textendash}like phenomena, whereas in dimensions greater than one, interesting phenomena can be organized along lines, hyperplanes and other non{\textendash}point{\textendash}like structures, for which wavelets are poorly adapted. We discuss in this paper a new subject, ridgelet analysis, which can effectively deal with line{\textendash}like phenomena in dimension 2, plane{\textendash}like phenomena in dimension 3 and so on. It encompasses a collection of tools which all begin from the idea of analysis by ridge functions ψ(u1x1 + ⃛ + unxn whose ridge profiles ψ are wavelets, or alternatively from performing a wavelet analysis in the Radon domain. The paper reviews recent work on the continuous ridgelet transform (CRT), ridgelet frames, ridgelet orthonormal bases, ridgelets and edges and describes a new notion of smoothness naturally attached to this new representation.},
