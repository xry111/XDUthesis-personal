# README

Several minutes ago, I mis-typed

    find -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;

in $HOME.  I'd used it to clean-up some un-tared source code packages in
$HOME/path/to/source/code, but then in $HOME I got it from bash history
and pressed enter no reason.

It's lucky that I pressed Ctrl+C quickly.  But I'm scared out of the hell.
Let's put a backup in Github.
